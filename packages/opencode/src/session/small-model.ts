// AR2 (cheap-model offload) — NARROW scope: digest large raw tool outputs on the
// small model before they enter the expensive model's transcript. The raw output
// is kept retrievable by ref, so the strategist can always pull ground truth.
//
// Opt-in only: the summarizer is built solely when a small model resolves
// (config `small_model`, or the provider's own small-model family). If none
// resolves, no summarizer is passed and every tool output stays verbatim — we
// never silently switch provider or drop detail.

// Outputs at or above this many characters are candidates for offload. Below it,
// the replay cost is small enough that keeping the raw output verbatim is cheaper
// than a round-trip to the small model. Set at 10KB (not lower) to protect DEPTH:
// mid-size raw outputs stay verbatim so a subtle-but-crucial detail on a hard
// challenge isn't compressed away — only genuinely large dumps get digested.

// Cap the text actually SENT to the small model. Large scan dumps make the
// offload call slow enough to time out (and it competes for provider
// concurrency). The full raw output is still kept retrievable by ref, so
// digesting a head+tail sample is safe — the digest is lossy either way and the
// ref holds ground truth.

// Only these tools' raw output is offloaded. Deliberately narrow: `bash` is where
// the 10-50 KB scan/enumeration dumps come from. Structured/precision tools
// (parsers, state_query, read, report_gen, …) are never summarized — their output
// is already compact and the agent needs it verbatim.
export const SUMMARIZE_TOOLS = new Set(["bash"])

// Universal backstop cap (C-4). AR2 offload only covers `bash` and only when a
// small model is configured; every other large output (a parser dumping a big
// /24 scan, state_query, or bash with no small model) previously rode the
// expensive transcript verbatim. Any tool output above this that the tool did
// NOT already summarize/truncate/ref is capped at the result boundary, with the
// full text kept retrievable by ref. Set above SUMMARIZE_THRESHOLD so the
// cheap-model digest (better than a blunt cut) always takes precedence for bash.

KEEP (verbatim, never mask or omit):
- credentials, tokens, hashes, API keys, secrets, session cookies
- open ports/services + versions, hostnames, URLs, endpoints, IPs, usernames
- vulnerabilities, CVEs, error/stack-trace lines that indicate a finding
- file paths, config values, flags, interesting response bodies

DROP: banners, ASCII art, progress bars, spinners, decorative separators, repeated boilerplate, timing/percentage noise, help text.

RULES:
- Preserve exact strings for anything exploitable (creds/tokens/paths/versions/payloads). Do NOT paraphrase those.
- Do NOT invent, infer, or add commentary, recommendations, or next steps.
- If the output is an error, a timeout, or empty, say so in one line.
- Output plain text. No markdown headers, no preamble like "Here is the digest".`
